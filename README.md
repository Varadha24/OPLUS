# Oplus

Creating our own A.I assistant is fascinating,right?  It would be far better if a virtual assistant could open online browsers, search Wikipedia to abstract required data, compose mail on our behalf, and execute a variety of other daily task with just one voice command. And now we offer you with Oplus, a Python-based virtual assistant.



Oplus is a program that recognises natural language voice commands and does activities on the user's behalf.
