# Oplus

Have you ever thought about having your own personal AI assistant? Consider how much easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, to do Wikipedia searches without opening a browser, and to carry out a variety of other daily operations such as playing music with just a single voice command. And now we offer you with Oplus, a Python-based virtual assistant.



Oplus is a program that recognises natural language voice commands and does activities on the user's behalf.
